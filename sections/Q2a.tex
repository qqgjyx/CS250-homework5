\textbf{Solution:}

\textbf{(a) Instruction Count}

In this part, we are asked to count the number of instructions, excluding labels and non-instruction directives. We will count the number of instructions both with and without including \texttt{nop} instructions, as they are actual instructions but do not perform any operation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{-O0 (Unoptimized version)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Total lines: 57 lines (from line 6 to line 62)
        \item With \texttt{nop}: There are a total of $\boxed{\textbf{57 instructions}}$.
        \item \sout{Without \texttt{nop}: There are \textbf{50 instructions} \text{(excluding 7 \texttt{nop} instructions)}.}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{-O3 (Optimized version)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Total lines: 32 lines (from line 2 to line 33)
        \item With \texttt{nop}: There are a total of $\boxed{\textbf{32 instructions}}$.
        \item \sout{Without \texttt{nop}: There are \textbf{32 instructions} \text{(since there are no \texttt{nop})}.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
